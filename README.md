## Overview

This repository contains tools and templates for creating Urban Institute-styled, html fact pages in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). For more information, read [Iterated fact sheets with R Markdown](https://medium.com/@urban_institute/iterated-fact-sheets-with-r-markdown-d685eb4eafce) and [Iterated PDFs with R Markdown](https://medium.com/@urban_institute/iterated-pdfs-with-r-markdown-144e2a6d6a1a).

## Getting started

### Lato font

The Urban Institute uses the font [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato). Go to `Control Panel` > `Appearance and Personalization` > `Fonts` to see if Lato is installed on your computer. Contact the IT Helpdesk if Lato isn't installed on your computer. 

Fonts are embedded in the PDFs with the [Cairo graphics library](https://www.cairographics.org/). Cairo is installed when R is installed. On Macs, Cairo won't work unless [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) is installed. 

### Download this repository

Download the contents of this repository to get access to the template. Using [R Projects](https://ui-research.github.io/r-at-urban/intro-to-r.html#projects) with the template is highly recommended and an R Project is included in the repository.  

## Use

`template.Rmd` contain settings and code to put R Markdown PDFs into the Urban Institute fact page style. Many of the changes are automated. 

## General guidelines

* No text smaller than 9 point.
* All headings and body text (including bullets, table text, etc.) should be flush left.
* First-level headings should be the second-most-prominent text on the page and should include a visual break (i.e., blank space). 12 pt Lato, bold, 12 points of space before the paragraph.
* Titles, subtitles, and author names should be centered at the top of page one.
* The title should be the most prominent text on page 1. Titles should be 15 pt Lato, bold, black.
* Subtitles should be 12 pt Lato, regular, Urban blue.
* Author name(s) should appear on page 1 under the title (and subtitle, if applicable). Author name(s) should be 11 pt Lato, italic, black, 12 points of space after the paragraph.
* Make heavy use of the [Urban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide](http://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/)

## Iteration

The template (for example, template.Rmd) is iterated with the `iterate.R` script. 

`iterate.R` takes an index, creates a data frame with outfile names and parameters, and iterates the template across each row of the data frame.
