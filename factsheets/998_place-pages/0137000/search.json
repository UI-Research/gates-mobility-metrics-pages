    "text": "Additional Notes on Data\n\nData Quality\n“Strong” indicates that the metric is measured with adequate accuracy and sample size.\n“Marginal” indicates that there are known shortcomings of the data for this metric for this community, and the metric should be used with caution.\n“Weak” indicates that although the metric could be computed for this community, we have serious concerns about how accurately it is measured for this community and do not recommend its use. Instead, we recommend seeking more local data sources for this metric.\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals\nConfidence intervals shown are 95 percent.\n* This confidence interval is not available at this time.\n+ A confidence interval is not applicable.\nLower/Upper bound: The data used to construct this metric do not lend themselves to conventional confidence intervals. The value of the metric shown represents are best estimate; the lower and upper bounds represent alternative estimates of the metric under different assumptions about missing data.\n\n“NC” in fields for confidence intervals or lower/upper bounds means that we are not able to calculate this because the underlying data lack variation.\n\n\n\nMissing and Suppressed Values\n\n“NA” in fields for metric values and data quality values indicates that the data are suppressed due to sample sizes or because that element is not applicable to that community (e.g., no zip code in the city is majority non-white).\n\n\nVersion: 2023-04-19 15:39:10"
