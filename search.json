Those who identify as other race or multiple races and Hispanic are counted in both the ‘Hispanic’ and ’Other Races and Ethnicities’ categories.The Confidence Interval for this metric is not applicable.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit here for more details about this predictor.\n\n\n\n\nPredictor: Racial diversity\n\nSummaryDetailMore Data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Metric: Index of people’s exposure to neighbors of different races and ethnicities\n    \n    \n      \n      Baldwin, Alabama\n    \n  \n  \n    % for Black, Non-Hispanic\n80.0%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Hispanic\n92.4%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Other Races and Ethnicities\n95.8%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for White, Non-Hispanic\n15.8%\n    Quality\nStrong\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: US Census Bureau’s 2021 5-Year American Community Survey.

Those who identify as other race or multiple races and Hispanic are counted in both the ‘Hispanic’ and ’Other Races and Ethnicities’ categories.The Confidence Interval for this metric is not applicable.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit here for more details about this predictor.\n\n\n\n\nPredictor: Racial diversity\n\nSummaryDetailMore Data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Metric: Index of people’s exposure to neighbors of different races and ethnicities\n    \n    \n      \n      Bibb, Alabama\n    \n  \n  \n    % for Black, Non-Hispanic\n61.5%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Hispanic\n96.4%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for Other Races and Ethnicities\n98.7%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for White, Non-Hispanic\n19.8%\n    Quality\nStrong\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: US Census Bureau’s 2021 5-Year American Community Survey.

Those who identify as other race or multiple races and Hispanic are counted in both the ‘Hispanic’ and ’Other Races and Ethnicities’ categories.The Confidence Interval for this metric is not applicable.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit here for more details about this predictor.\n\n\n\n\nPredictor: Racial diversity\n\nSummaryDetailMore Data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Metric: Index of people’s exposure to neighbors of different races and ethnicities\n    \n    \n      \n      Bullock, Alabama\n    \n  \n  \n    % for Black, Non-Hispanic\n21.3%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Hispanic\n99.4%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for Other Races and Ethnicities\n96.9%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for White, Non-Hispanic\n71.7%\n    Quality\nStrong\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: US Census Bureau’s 2021 5-Year American Community Survey.

Those who identify as other race or multiple races and Hispanic are counted in both the ‘Hispanic’ and ’Other Races and Ethnicities’ categories.The Confidence Interval for this metric is not applicable.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit here for more details about this predictor.\n\n\n\n\nPredictor: Racial diversity\n\nSummaryDetailMore Data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Metric: Index of people’s exposure to neighbors of different races and ethnicities\n    \n    \n      \n      Calhoun, Alabama\n    \n  \n  \n    % for Black, Non-Hispanic\n60.7%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Hispanic\n90.9%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Other Races and Ethnicities\n94.2%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for White, Non-Hispanic\n21.8%\n    Quality\nStrong\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: US Census Bureau’s 2021 5-Year American Community Survey.

Those who identify as other race or multiple races and Hispanic are counted in both the ‘Hispanic’ and ’Other Races and Ethnicities’ categories.The Confidence Interval for this metric is not applicable.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit here for more details about this predictor.\n\n\n\n\nPredictor: Racial diversity\n\nSummaryDetailMore Data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Metric: Index of people’s exposure to neighbors of different races and ethnicities\n    \n    \n      \n      Cherokee, Alabama\n    \n  \n  \n    % for Black, Non-Hispanic\n93.9%\n    Quality\nMarginal\n    % for Hispanic\n97.9%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for Other Races and Ethnicities\n97.4%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for White, Non-Hispanic\n8.1%\n    Quality\nStrong\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: US Census Bureau’s 2021 5-Year American Community Survey.

Those who identify as other race or multiple races and Hispanic are counted in both the ‘Hispanic’ and ’Other Races and Ethnicities’ categories.The Confidence Interval for this metric is not applicable.\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit here for more details about this predictor.\n\n\n\n\nPredictor: Racial diversity\n\nSummaryDetailMore Data\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      Metric: Index of people’s exposure to neighbors of different races and ethnicities\n    \n    \n      \n      Choctaw, Alabama\n    \n  \n  \n    % for Black, Non-Hispanic\n40.2%\n    Quality\nStrong\n    % for Hispanic\n98.5%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for Other Races and Ethnicities\n99.3%\n    Quality\nWeak\n    % for White, Non-Hispanic\n30.6%\n    Quality\nStrong\n  \n  \n    \n      Source: US Census Bureau’s 2021 5-Year American Community Survey.

Instead, we recommend seeking more local data sources for this metric.\n\n\n\nConfidence Intervals\nConfidence intervals shown are 95 percent.\n* This confidence interval is not available at this time.\n+ A confidence interval is not applicable.\nLower/Upper bound: The data used to construct this metric do not lend themselves to conventional confidence intervals. The value of the metric shown represents are best estimate; the lower and upper bounds represent alternative estimates of the metric under different assumptions about missing data.\n\n“NC” in fields for confidence intervals or lower/upper bounds means that we are not able to calculate this because the underlying data lack variation.\n\n\n\nMissing and Suppressed Values\n\n“NA” in fields for metric values and data quality values indicates that the data are suppressed due to sample sizes or because that element is not applicable to that community (e.g., no zip code in the county is majority non-white).\n\n\nVersion: 2023-04-09 08:51:45"
